Here’s a list of the necessary libraries and packages you need to import and install to ensure the code runs smoothly. You may want to install them using pip or conda based on your environment.

Python Libraries and Packages:

pandas – For handling dataframes and CSV files.
numpy – For numerical computations.
matplotlib – For plotting and visualizations.
seaborn – For enhanced data visualizations, such as confusion matrix heatmaps.
re – For regular expressions (used in text preprocessing).
nltk – For natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
textblob – For sentiment analysis (polarity and subjectivity scores).

Libraries and Their Corresponding Pip Install Commands:
# Install pandas for data manipulation
!pip install pandas

# Install numpy for numerical operations
!pip install numpy

# Install matplotlib for plotting
!pip install matplotlib

# Install seaborn for advanced visualizations
!pip install seaborn

# Install nltk for natural language processing
!pip install nltk

# Install textblob for sentiment analysis
!pip install textblob

!pip install sklearn

!pip install spacy

Additional Setup (for NLTK):
Make sure to download the required corpora for NLTK, such as stopwords and wordnet.

import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng')  # For POS tagging

Ensure All Required Libraries are Imported:

# Data manipulation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# NLP tasks
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
from textblob import Word

# Machine Learning
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Utilities
import re

Given the list that will cover all the dependencies in this code. Make sure to install and import these packages before running the code!
